# Sex Differences in T1-weighted Brain MRI

In this repository, we share the code used to investigate sex differences in brain MRI. The data used in this investigation comes from the Calgary-Campinas public dataset.

What we provide?

3D pre-trained VGG-like models for predicting sex
Grad-CAM visualizations highlighting sex differences in the brain
Analysis of potential sex impact when developing predictive models
